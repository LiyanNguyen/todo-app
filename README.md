### My Process
- Design the Mobile viewport WHILE desinging the Desktop Viewport at the same time using
- Design the flex/grid system, making sure to have both Desktop and Mobile Viewport layout correct
- Add in all the other HTML content
- Finished up all the CSS designs
- Write the JavaScript logic one by one until all desired features are added

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I Learned
- Doing projects like this in vanilla JS is a bad idea, better use a framework! because of shared state between components, so you dont have to manually do checks for every function calling other functions when something happens
- nextSibling
- previousSibling
- previousElementSibling
- nextElementSibling
- parentElement
- cloneNode + replaceWith (trick to keep the element but removed the event listeners binded to it)
